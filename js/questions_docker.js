questions = [
  { q: "In Docker networking, what is the main difference between 'bridge' and 'host' network modes?", options: ["Bridge isolates container networking with NAT, host shares the hostâ€™s network stack", "Bridge provides encryption, host disables networking", "Bridge uses overlay, host requires swarm", "Bridge allows IPv6 only, host IPv4 only"], answer: 0 },
  
  { q: "Why are multi-stage builds recommended in Dockerfiles?", options: ["They reduce image size by excluding build tools from final image", "They allow parallel container execution", "They improve runtime performance of containers", "They increase compatibility with Windows containers"], answer: 0 },
  
  { q: "What is the main security risk of running a container with '--privileged' flag?", options: ["Container gets access to host kernel capabilities and devices", "Container loses network isolation", "Docker daemon shuts down automatically", "Privileged mode disables SELinux"], answer: 0 },
  
  { q: "How does Docker overlay network work in Swarm mode?", options: ["It allows containers across different nodes to communicate via VXLAN tunneling", "It maps host network directly to containers", "It encrypts container traffic with TLS by default", "It creates a shared storage volume for containers"], answer: 0 },
  
  { q: "What is the effect of using 'docker commit' in production pipelines?", options: ["It creates immutable, reproducible images", "It breaks immutability by creating images from running container state", "It signs images with Docker Content Trust", "It optimizes layers for smaller image size"], answer: 1 },
  
  { q: "How does Docker Content Trust (DCT) enhance image security?", options: ["By enabling TLS encryption for registry traffic", "By signing and verifying image tags with Notary to prevent tampering", "By blocking all unsigned Dockerfiles", "By enforcing container scanning with Trivy"], answer: 1 },
  
  { q: "In a Dockerfile, why is 'ENTRYPOINT [\"executable\"]' often combined with 'CMD [\"args\"]'?", options: ["ENTRYPOINT defines the main executable, CMD provides default arguments", "ENTRYPOINT runs only if CMD fails", "ENTRYPOINT is for Windows containers, CMD for Linux", "ENTRYPOINT runs before COPY instructions"], answer: 0 },
  
  { q: "What problem does 'docker system prune' help mitigate?", options: ["It removes dangling images, stopped containers, and unused networks to free disk space", "It prevents container privilege escalation", "It rebuilds corrupted container layers", "It upgrades the Docker Engine"], answer: 0 },
  
  { q: "Why is 'distroless' base image used in production?", options: ["It provides OS-level package managers for flexibility", "It reduces attack surface by excluding shells, package managers, and unnecessary binaries", "It automatically patches vulnerabilities", "It allows GPU acceleration in containers"], answer: 1 },
  
  { q: "In Docker Swarm, what does 'docker service scale myapp=5' do?", options: ["Scales container resources (CPU/memory) per replica", "Ensures exactly 5 replicas of 'myapp' service are running across swarm nodes", "Scales up Docker daemon to 5 threads", "Creates 5 overlay networks for myapp"], answer: 1 }
